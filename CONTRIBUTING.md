# Hello Contributor!
Thank you for considering contributing. Your input, ideas and productive criticism are much appreciated!


## Introduction
These guidelines should help to communicate and collaborate with each other on this project.
Following these guidelines helps to save time and to be more productive.

There are many ways to contribute like submitting bug reports or feature requests, 
improving documentation or writing tutorials. As already mentions every input is appreciated.


## Ground Rules

> Issue before PR

To save your own time and prevent frustration start by 
[creating an issue](https://github.com/emakina-cee-oss/javascript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-issues) 
before submitting a Pull Request. This way others can share their opinions on your input.
Maybe there won't be a need for a code change or another solution can derive from your thoughts.
As soon there is a need for code change, go for it and create a pull request!

> It is time for Bullet Points
